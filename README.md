# react-applaus-o-meter
The Applaus-O-Meter enables authentical rankings by measuring the intensity of the applause.

Originally invented for a local Poetry Slam in order to increase the participation and the enthusiasm of the audience. 
The crowd is actually capable of declaring their favourite candidate as the winner. As a result long-term votings by handsign or slips of 
paper can be easily relinquished. The program might have the potential to become more popular and requested among larger audiences.
